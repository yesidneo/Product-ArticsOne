Project Overview
This project is a multiplatform web application that combines a 3D animation scroll with GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) and React Fiber. Additionally, it integrates an AR (Augmented Reality) experience that runs directly in the browser.

The main goal of the application is to provide users with an immersive and interactive scrolling experience using advanced animations and effects. The 3D animation scroll is implemented using GSAP, a powerful JavaScript animation library. It allows for smooth and visually appealing transitions between sections as the user scrolls through the content.

The AR experience is built on web technologies, enabling users to access augmented reality features directly in their browser, without the need for additional installations or plugins. This provides a seamless and user-friendly AR experience on multiple platforms.

Key Features
3D Animation Scroll: Utilizes GSAP and React Fiber to create a visually stunning and interactive scrolling experience. The animations are optimized for performance and smooth transitions between sections.

Augmented Reality (AR): Enables users to access AR features directly in their web browser. This eliminates the need for separate AR apps and enhances the accessibility of the AR experience.

Multiplatform Support: The web app is designed to work seamlessly on multiple platforms, including desktop, mobile, and tablet devices. It utilizes responsive design principles to adapt the user interface to different screen sizes and orientations.

Technologies Used
React: The project is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React Fiber, the internal architecture of React, is leveraged to efficiently manage the rendering and reconciliation process.

GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform): GSAP is utilized for implementing the 3D animation scroll. It provides a robust set of animation tools and optimized performance for smooth animations.

Augmented Reality (AR) Web Technologies: The project leverages web-based AR technologies to deliver the AR experience directly in the browser. This includes technologies such as WebXR, WebRTC, and WebGL.
